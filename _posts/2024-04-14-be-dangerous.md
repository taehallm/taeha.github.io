# Be dangerous enough to start a fire

As an entrepreneur, the notion that you must be the best before you step into the arena is not only daunting but often unrealistic. Embrace the concept of being "dangerously" good enough. This means having a competent grasp of your field or technology to build a prototype or a concept that demonstrates the potential of your idea.

The true magic happens when you start sharing your work. Itâ€™s about getting your concept out there and attracting the attention of those who are more skilled, who can then help elevate your project to the next level. Remember, you don't have to be the best at everything. You just need to be good enough to start a conversation, to spark interest, and to create something that others can contribute to. By being "dangerous," you become a catalyst for better development, drawing in experts who can enhance your vision.

So, take that first step. Be good enough to be dangerous, and let the community of brilliant minds around you help navigate the journey from a promising idea to a successful venture. This approach not only accelerates innovation but also fosters a collaborative environment where knowledge and skills are leveraged for collective success.
